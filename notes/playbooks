every playbook is written in .yml
they start with --- on top line
they have a list of plays
each play in the list starts with a '-'
2 keys inside each play
[1] hosts: # selector for which hosts against which to run the play
[2] tasks: # list of tasks to execute
 Notes: indentation matters inside the playbook

 the 4 pillars:
 1. the packages that you require
 2. the service handlers i.e. systemd etc.
 3. the overall sys config. files, users etc, firewall or ip table rules
 4. config files for the app itself

 1. package management
 state= present # if it is there already, do nothing
      = latest # update/install
