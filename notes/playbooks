every playbook is written in .yml
they start with --- on top line
they have a list of plays
each play in the list starts with a '-'
2 keys inside each play
[1] hosts: # selector for which hosts against which to run the play
[2] tasks: # list of tasks to execute
 Notes: indentation matters inside the playbook
